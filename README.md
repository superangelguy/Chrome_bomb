# ðŸ’£ Bomb HTML Script ðŸ’£

> Boom! ðŸ’¥ A simple but explosive HTML file that'll make your browser go wild! 

This is a fun little HTML file containing JavaScript commands that perform some browser magic! ðŸŽ©âœ¨

## File Contents
- `Bomb.html` - The one and only! ðŸŽ¯

## Functionality
The script contains two explosive JavaScript commands:
1. `window.open()` - Kaboom! ðŸ’¥ Opens a new browser window
2. `location.reload()` - Whoosh! ðŸŒ€ Reloads the current page

## Usage
Just double-click the HTML file and watch the magic happen! ðŸŽª 
Note: Some browsers might be party poopers and block the `window.open()` command due to popup blocking settings. ðŸš«

## Security Note
This script is like a firework - fun but handle with care! ðŸŽ† 
Make sure to review the code before running it, as opening new windows and reloading pages can affect your browsing experience.
